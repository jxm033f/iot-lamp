# Module 3: Wireless Lamp
COMS BC 3930

Through this module, I created a wireless lamp that reacts to a photoresister and some interactions via buttons and potentiometer. The feautures that this lamp includes are changes color based on current temperature, changes brightness based on the amount of light and sets time when the lamp will turn automatically off which will provide a sound to the Raspberry a minute before the lamp will turn off.
