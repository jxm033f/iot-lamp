# Module 3: Wireless Lamp
COMS BC 3930

Through this module, I created a wireless lamp that reacts to a photoresister and some interactions via buttons and potentiometer. The feautures that this lamp includes are changes color based on current temperature, changes brightness based on the amount of light and sets time when the lamp will turn automatically off which will provide a sound to the Raspberry a minute before the lamp will turn off.

## Materials
- Raspberry Pi
- ESP32
- 2 large buttons
- 1 Potentiometer
- 1 Photoresistor
- 1 LiPo Battery
- 8 LEDs (2 Green, 2 Blue, 2 Yellow, 2 Red)

## Hardware Configuration
### Buttons
Blue Button  - Pin 2 <br />
Green Button - Pin 0 <br />

### Potentiometer
Pin 21

### Photoresistor
Pin 5

### LEDs
Green 1 - Pin 14 <br />
Green 2 - Pin 13 <br />
Blue 1 - Pin 12 <br />
Blue 2 - Pin 19 <br />
Yellow 1 - Pin 19 <br />
Yellow 2 - Pin 4 <br />
Red 1 - Pin 18 <br />
Red 2 - Pin 15 <br />

## Executing Program
1. Go to [Arduino Site](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Download Linux ARM 32-bit (or one based on correct Operating System)
3. Extract file and install the Arduino IDE in dowloaded directory (eg. Downloads)
```bash
cd Downloads
tar -xvf arduino-1.8.13-linuxarm.tar.xz
cd arduino-1.8.13
sudo ./install.sh
```
4. Clone iot-lamp
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jxm033f/iot-lamp.git
cd iot-lamp
```
5. Open Arduino IDE -> File -> Open -> mod4-wifi.ino <br />
        1. File is located iot-lamp/mod4-wifi
6. Upload Code which will allow it to run through the ESP32 <br />
        1. After succesfully uploading you can disconnect the comp from the ESP32
7. Then run mod4-wireless.py on Terminal in iot-lamp directory
```bash
python3 setting_locker.py
```
